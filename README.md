# Illinux - My Attempt at Creating a Flavor of Linux

Illinux is my pitiful attempt at creating my own flavor of linux from scratch. Calling it **Ill**inux to emphasize the fact that this is a makeshift OS that, while stable, performs below industry standards.
  
If not already understood: this OS is not meant to be used seriously, it is simply a learning project for me. But hey, what do you know, this could turn into something substantial, right?
